The letter has no salutation
your sunflowers on a yellow background  which I regard as a perfect page of an essential ‘Vincent’ style. At your brother’s home I saw your Sower,  which is very good, as well as a yellow still life, apples and lemons.  Your brother gave me a lithographed reproduction of an old painting of yours, Dutch – very interesting as regards colour in the drawing.  In my studio  next to your portrait.
The grape harvests  are totally covered in scales as a result of the  white  which has separated. I’ve stuck all of it back down using
a process shown to me by the reliner.  If I tell you about it it’s because the thing is easy to do and can be very good for those of your canvases that need retouching – you stick newspapers on your canvas with  flour paste.  Once dry, you put your canvas on a smooth board and with very hot irons you press down  hard  on it. All the breaks in your colour will remain but will be flattened down and you’ll have a  very fine  surface. Afterwards you soak your paper covering well and take off all the paper.
That’s largely the whole secret of relining.
Thank  Roulin  for thinking of me. I have indeed received my stretcher keys  – at the next opportunity if you can send me by parcel post my 2 fencing masks and gloves,  which I left on the shelf in the little upstairs room.
Friendly wishes from me to everyone.
Cordially yours,

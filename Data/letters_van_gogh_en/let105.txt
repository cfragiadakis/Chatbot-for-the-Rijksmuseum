When the Lord’s Supper is next celebrated here I’ll attend it,  you should do the same in The Hague, let us go as  true participants in the Lord’s Supper .
And take this piece of rye bread too, and eat it, as I do, with our thoughts turned toward our Father’s house  and to the things we heard and saw there.
And believe me
Your most loving and affectionate brother
Vincent
And pray: Lord, bless this food!
Herewith Ecce Homo,  send me Mater Dolorosa.  Adieu, old boy, a handshake in thought.

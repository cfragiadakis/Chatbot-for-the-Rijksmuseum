Dear  Sir ,
I’m not sure whether I can come and paint next Saturday. Because I’m making a couple of studies here — of the potato planting  — on which I may possibly have to continue to work on the day in question.
But if not Saturday, I’ll come anyway — unless I hear from you to the contrary — on Monday.
Yours truly,
Vincent

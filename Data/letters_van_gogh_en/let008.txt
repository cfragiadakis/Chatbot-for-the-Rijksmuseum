The Hague, 9 May 1873
My dear Theo,
On Monday morning I’ll leave Helvoirt for Paris, passing through Brussels at 2:07.  Do come to the station if you can; it would give me great pleasure.
Before I forget, yesterday
I showed your portrait to  Mrs Tersteeg ,  and she would like very much to have one. Would you have a chance to get another one and send it to me?
If you can’t do it now, try to think of it some other time.
Theo, you have no idea how kind to me they all are here;  you can imagine how sorry I am to have to part from so many friends.
Adieu, old chap, give my warm regards to  Uncle  and  Aunt .  Goodbye for now.
Vincent.

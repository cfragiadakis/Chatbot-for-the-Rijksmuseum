Sunday evening, 5 May 1889
Having to go away tomorrow and being busy on Tuesdays, I place myself at your disposal to accompany you to St-Rémy on Wednesday.  We would leave by the 8.51 train, if that suits you. Having already seen  Mr Peyron , it is appropriate that I should accompany you myself.
Yours truly,
Salles

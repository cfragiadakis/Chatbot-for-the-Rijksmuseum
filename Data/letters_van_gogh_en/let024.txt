Dearest  Betsy ,
I had wanted to fill this little book with drawings for you,  but Theo is leaving today,  so I don’t have any more time. You’ll just have to have it the way it is, and when I come back next year I’ll make a new one. Next Monday  I’m going back to London with my sister  Anna , to the house I’ve drawn for you,  and then I’ll be travelling on the little steamboat that I’ve
drawn here.  Well,  Betsy , adieu, until next year.
Vincent

[Letterhead: Goupil Paris]
Paris, 13 Sept. 1875.
My dear Theo,
The photographs of the  J. Breton  and the  Corot  are for Helvoirt;  the rest are for you.
Send on the Helvoirt ones when you have the opportunity, but I’ll do my best to get another copy of the  Rembrandt ,  so perhaps it would be better to delay sending them until I’ve sent you that one as well.
You’ll have received my letter of yesterday by now.
Warm regards,
Vt.

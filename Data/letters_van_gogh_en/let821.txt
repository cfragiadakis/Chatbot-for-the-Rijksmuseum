St-Rémy in Provence
Sir ,
I accept with pleasure your invitation to exhibit with the Vingtistes.  Here is the list of canvases I intend for you
No 1 Sunflowers
2 Sunflowers
3 The ivy
4 Orchard in blossom (Arles)
5 Wheatfield. Rising sun (St-Rémy)
6 The red vineyard (Montmajour)
(All these canvases are no. 30 canvases.)
I am perhaps exceeding the 4 metres of room but as I believe that the 6 together, thus chosen, will make a rather varied colour effect, perhaps you will find a way of placing them.
Please accept the expression of my entire fellow-feeling for the Vingtistes.
Vincent van Gogh
